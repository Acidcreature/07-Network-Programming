# **Open Systems Interconnection model** \(**OSI model**\)![](/assets/osi.PNG)

The OSI model divides the complex task of computer-to-computer communications into a series of stages known as _layers_. [Layers in the OSI model](https://www.lifewire.com/layers-of-the-osi-model-illustrated-818017) are ordered from â€‹the lowest level to highest. Together, these layers comprise the OSI stack. The stack contains seven layers in two groups:

**Upper layers:**

* 1. application
* 1. presentation
* 1. session

**Lower layers:**

* 1. transport
* 1. network
* 1. data link
* 1. physical
