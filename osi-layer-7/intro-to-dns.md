# Introduction to Domain Name Servers

Domain names are for the benefit of humans.

IPs are difficult to remember, and if they change it is almost impossible to fully advertise the new IP to everyone.

DNS maps domain names to IPs, and can advertise the services each domain offers \(HTTP, MAIL, etc\).

Operates on UDP port 53.
