# HTTP Requests

#### **HTTP Requests**

* The only MANDATORY parts of an HTTP Request are the METHOD, the URL, HTTP version, and the host \(and any data you need to send if POSTING\).
* We will only discuss the methods GET and POST because they are almost exclusively what you will encounter, however others do exist.
