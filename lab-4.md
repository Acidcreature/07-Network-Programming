1\) Generate a valid IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation to your classmate, that elicits a neighbor advertisement.



Ensure both the solicitation and advertisement are viewable in Wireshark



Valid means it conforms the RFC, Wireshark confirms it is not malformed/displays no errors, and your request produces a reply



Depending on the setup of an OS, there MIGHT be a timeout on how many Neighbor Advertisements can be sent out in a period of time. If there is nothing else wrong with your code, wait 2-3 mins and try again.
