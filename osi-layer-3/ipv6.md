# Internet Protocol version 6

IPv6 is the latest version. It returns to the cleaner design of IP that IPv4 had before attempts to curb exhaustion happened.



Differences from IPv4:



* Back to single address per host, address translation is no longer needed
* Multicasting,QoS,IPSec, and Encryption is built in
* IPv6 can autoconfigure itself in a local network
