# **RFC - Request For Comment**

Originally \(in the ARPANET days\), an RFC was a semi-formal document of ideas shared to get comments from peers. Now they are issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\) to formally define an accepted specification.



RFCs describe and define the history, implementation, formats, and use of protocols. They are the authoritative source of information regarding protocols.
