# Introduction to Domain Name System

Domain names are for the benefit of humans.

IPs are difficult to remember, and if they change it is almost impossible to fully advertise the new IP to everyone. DNS maps domain names to IPs, and can advertise the services each domain offers \(HTTP, MAIL, etc\). Operates on UDP port 53. It's is the networking system in place that allows us to resolve human-friendly names to unique addresses.

### Top-Level Domain {#top-level-domain}

A top-level domain, or TLD, is the most general part of the domain. The top-level domain is the furthest portion to the right \(as separated by a dot\). Common top-level domains are "com", "net", "org", "gov", "edu", and "io".
