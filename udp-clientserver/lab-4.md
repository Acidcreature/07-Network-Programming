**Lab 4A**

Write a UDP sender that takes a dictionary, turns it into a JSON string, and sends it to a listener.

Write the UDP receiver to receive the JSON string and turns it back into a dictionary.

Validate by printing the type of your dictionary variable.

**Lab 4B**

Write a UDP receiver that receives a string, and orders the words from longest to shortest in a new string.



That new string should be sent to the remote port+1.

\(i.e. the source port of message from the SENDER's POV\)



Write a UDP sender that sends the initial string, and receives the response from the receiver above.



Hint: The second step is intentionally ambiguous on how to proceed. There are multiple solutions.
