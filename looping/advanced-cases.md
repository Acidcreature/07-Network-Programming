# setsockopt\(\) and getsockopt\(\)

Using socket options gives you some advanced options for sockets to do interesting things.

Options have a LEVEL, OPTION NAME, and a VALUE.

* LEVEL can be the entire socket \(socket.SOL\_SOCKET\) or a specific protocol \(socket.IPPROTO\_IPV6\).
* The LEVEL specified determines what OPTION NAMEs are available to be set.
* VALUES are assigned to the specified OPTION NAME.

Unfortunately, options are scattered all over the place in documentation. Man pages are currently the best source or for a grouping of common ones, see the refs.

The default socket buffer size may not be suitable in many circumstances. In such circumstances, you can change the default socket buffer size to a more suitable value.

## How to do it...

Let us manipulate the default socket buffer size using a socket object's`setsockopt()`method.

First, define two constants:`SEND_BUF_SIZE`/`RECV_BUF_SIZE`and then wrap a socket instance's call to the`setsockopt()`method in a function. It is also a good idea to check the value of the buffer size before modifying it. Note that we need to set up the send and receive buffer size separately.

Listing 1.8 shows how to modify socket send/receive buffer sizes as follows:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# Python Network Programming Cookbook -- Chapter â€“ 1
# This program is optimized for Python 2.7. It may run on any
# other Python version with/without modifications

import socket

SEND_BUF_SIZE = 4096
RECV_BUF_SIZE = 4096

def modify_buff_size():
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM )
    
    # Get the size of the socket's send buffer
    bufsize = sock.getsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_SNDBUF)
    print "Buffer size [Before]:%d" %bufsize
    
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)
    sock.setsockopt(
            socket.SOL_SOCKET,
            socket.SO_SNDBUF,
            SEND_BUF_SIZE)
    sock.setsockopt(
            socket.SOL_SOCKET,
            socket.SO_RCVBUF,
            RECV_BUF_SIZE)
    bufsize = sock.getsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_SNDBUF)
    print "Buffer size [After]:%d" %bufsize

if __name__ == '__main__':
    modify_buff_size()
```

If you run the preceding script, it will show the changes in the socket's buffer size. The following output may be different on your machine depending on your operating system's local settings:

```
$ python 1_8_modify_buff_size.py 
Buffer size [Before]:16384
Buffer size [After]:8192
```

## How it works...

You can call the`getsockopt()`and`setsockopt()`methods on a socket object to retrieve and modify the socket object's properties respectively. The`setsockopt()`method takes three arguments:`level`,`optname`, and`value`. Here,`optname`takes the option name and`value`is thecorrespondingvalue of that option. For the first argument, the needed symbolic constants can be found in the socket module \(`SO_*etc.`\).
