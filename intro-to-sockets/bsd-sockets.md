Part of the trouble with understanding these things is that “socket” can mean a number of subtly different things, depending on context. So first, let’s make a distinction between a “client” socket - an endpoint of a conversation, and a “server” socket, which is more like a switchboard operator. The client application \(your browser, for example\) uses “client” sockets exclusively; the web server it’s talking to uses both “server” sockets and “client” sockets.
