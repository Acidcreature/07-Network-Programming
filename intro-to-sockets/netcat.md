# **NetCat**

Netcat is the "swiss army knife" of networking. It is a simple networking program that can be used as a client or server. Any data that is received is printed to the terminal \(or file if using file redirection\). Netcat supports both IPv4/IPv6 and TCP/UDP. You can use netcat to receive traffic you are sending, or to simulate a client accessing a server.

If you need to download Netcat, there should be a copt in the download file:
