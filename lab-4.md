#### Lab 3A

Write a UDP receiver that receives a string, and orders the words from longest to shortest in a new string.

That new string should be sent to the remote port+1.

\(i.e. the source port of message from the SENDER's POV\)

Write a UDP sender that sends the initial string, and receives the response from the receiver above.

Hint: The second step is intentionally ambiguous on how to proceed. There are multiple solutions.

#### Lab 3B

Create a TCP server that takes a 32 bit value packs it into 

struct pack/unpack

host to network byte order

buffer sizes

socket timeout

handling socket errors

modifying send.rec buffer size

echo server

file transfer
