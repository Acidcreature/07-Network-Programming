# **Endianess**

A number is represented by a sequence of bytes. A 32 bit integer is 4 bytes.

*  Least Significant Byte \(LSB\)- The byte representing the smallest part of a number \(e.g. the "ones"\)
*  Most Significant Byte \(MSB\) The place representing the largest part of a number



Endianness tells us how to read a grouping of bytes.

*  Big Endian - MSB is first
*  Little Endian - LSB is first
