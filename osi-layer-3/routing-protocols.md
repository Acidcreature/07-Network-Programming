# Routing Protocols

Routers operate on Layer 3.

They ignore Layer 2 addresses for decision making.

* Multiple Collision Domains
* Multiple Broadcast Domains



Routing protocols allow neighboring routers to collaborate dynamically.



There are two main types: distance-vector and link-state.



Distance-vector protocols attempt to calculate the "distance" between networks. Usually this is the total number of hops, or the sum of all weights on a path.



Link-state protocols are more concerned with speed and current state of the connections. A longer path with a faster travel time will be prioritized over a path with less hops.



Hybrid protocols also exist.
