# **Introduction to Python Network Programming**

## _Objectives_

* Perform socket programming for TCP and UDP in Python without supervision.
* Understand and explain fundamental concepts of networking, at both a high level and byte level.
* View network traffic and explain what is ocurring at a high level and at a byte level.
* Be able to independently gather missing information from proper sources to solve a \(socket programming\) problem.
* Be able to analyze and/or debug networking issues with Wireshark, Netcat, and Python in the absense of information.

#### During this class you will be expected to perform tasks individually and on teams.  You will be tasked to do things that are unfamiliar with nowhere to lookup the entire problem.

#### The slides will **NOT **cover everything in detail. I will cover topics at a high level, provide you references for the implementation, and assist in learning the tools to debug your code.

#### I expect you to use those resources and make an effort to figure things out for yourself.





# **Environment**

* The majority of the labs will use IPv6 using BSD Sockets.
* We will be using multiple Virtual Machines of Linux, because Windows does not support BSD Sockets.
* If you need assistance with Linux, let us know during the lab portions.
