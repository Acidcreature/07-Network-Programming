# **Numbering Systems**

bit = 1 or 0

nibble = 4 bits, half a byte

octet = 8 bits

A byte on most computers is the same as an octet

##### **Binary uses only 1's and 0's**

0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000...

##### **Hexadecimal - base 16**

Counting: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11,12, 13....

A single hex digit = 4 bits/half a byte

##### **Octal - base 8**

Counting: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20...

##### **Decimal - base 10**

Counting: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

**Place value is the key.**

In decimal our BASE is 10:

BASE ^ 0 = 10^0 = 1,  "ones"

BASE ^ 1 = 10^1 = 10,  "tens"

BASE ^ 2 = 10^2 = 100,  "hundreds“

A number like 25 is broken down:

\(2\*10\) + \(5\*1\) = 20+5 = 25

**In hexadecimal the "tens" place is actually "sixteens", and  the "ones" stays the same but now consists of 15 numbers, 0 to F.**

BASE is 16:

 BASE ^ 0 = 16^0 = 1, "ones"

 BASE ^ 1 = 16^1 = 16, "sixteens"

 BASE ^ 2 = 16^2 = 256,  "256ths“

Convert 2A into decimal

 \(2\*16\) + \(A\*1\) = \(2\*16\) + \(10\*1\) = 32+10 = 42
