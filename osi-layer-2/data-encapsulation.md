# Data Encapsulation

![](../.gitbook/assets/encapsulation.PNG)

**Data Encapsulation:**  The process of taking data from one protocol and translating it into another protocol, so the data can continue across the network.   During encapsulation, each layer builds a protocol data unit \(PDU\) by adding a header \(and sometimes a footer\) containing control information to the PDU from the layer above.
