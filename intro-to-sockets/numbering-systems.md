# **Numbering Systems**

bit = 1 or 0

nibble = 4 bits, half a byte

octet = 8 bits

A byte on most computers is the same as an octet

##### **Binary uses only 1's and 0's**

 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000...

##### **Hexadecimal - base 16**

 Counting: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11,12, 13....

 A single hex digit = 4 bits/half a byte

##### **Octal - base 8**

 Counting: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20...

##### **Decimal - base 10**

 Counting: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...
