# **Introduction to Sockets**

* Network programming is a major use of Python 
* The Python Standard Library has wide support for network protocols, data encoding/decoding, and other things you need to make it work 
* Writing network programs in Python tends to be substantially easier than in C/C++
* We will only cover modules supported by the Python standard library
* These come with Python by default

* Keep in mind, much more functionality can be found in third-party modules

* There will be links to notable third-party libraries and resources as appropriate
