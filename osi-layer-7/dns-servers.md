# DNS Servers

The system is very simple at a high-level overview, but is very complex as you look at the details. Overall though, it is a very reliable infrastructure that has been essential to the adoption of the internet as we know it today.

### Root Servers

 The Internet root name servers manage DNS server information for the Web's top-level domains \(TLD\) \(like ".com" and ".uk"\), specifically the names and IP addresses of the original \(called _authoritative_\) DNS servers responsible for answering queries about each TLD individually.

DNS servers are installed and maintained by private businesses and Internet governing bodies around the world. For the Internet, 13 root name servers \(actually redundant pools of machines around the world\) support the hundreds of Internet top-level domains.  Organizations can similarly deploy DNS on their private networks separately, on the smaller scale.
