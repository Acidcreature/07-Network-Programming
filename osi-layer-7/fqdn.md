# Fully Qualified Domain Name

**FQDN -** the complete domain name of a host, which combines the network domain with the host's name.

* mail3.example.com



A typical domain name used to access a website is NOT a FQDN because that domain does not reference a non-specific host, but one of several that can serve webpages for that domain.

* www.example.com may ultimately be served by webserver.example.com or www2.example.com



A technically correct FQDN ends with a . as a reference to the root domain.

* While it is the best kind of correct, this isn't always reflected in reality
